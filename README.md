### SQL (Structured Query Language)

- It is used to interact with Databases and extract information from Large Datasets.
- It is used to clean and prepare Datasets for Analysis.
- It gives Summary of information in a dataset.
- It helps filter,extract,join and agrregate datasets.
- It is essential for back-end data handling.
- Super fast at processing large databases.
 - **I have learnt**:

-It has strong Backend data manipulation features with access to simple visualization.
-It has limitation of size of dataset (1000) and truncates the rest of the data in case of larger dataset.
-It has features like:Interphase,Report View,Table view,DAX Query view.
It uses DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations.
  
 - **Supported Data sources are**:
    - Flat files (Excel/CSV)
    - SQL Database
    - Azure cloud platform
    - Blank Query
- **I Learnt the use of funtion like:**
